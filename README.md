# Advent of Code 2024 Submissions

Hello!
These are [my](https://github.com/TheLDB) submissions for the Advent Of Code 2024.

I'm using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) because it's a very nice language to write, and I want to get better at it!

I'm also challenging myself to use Vim Motions while completing these, because I want to become more efficient.

Happy Holidays! ☃️
